# XPS OPERATING MANUAL

## ION SOURCE

***ONLY OPERATE AT PRESSURES < 5E-6 mbar***

### Procedure after bakeout / chamber vent

Start the power supply and leave it in Stand by mode for 10 minutes to warm up and stabilize the cathode.

Start the DEGAS option for atleast 20 minutes, or longer until chamber vacuum drops down to E-9 mbar regime.

### Regular procedure

#### Switching ON

Start the power supply and leave it in Stand by mode for 10 minutes to warm up and stabilize the cathode.

If the ion source has been out of operation for some time, DEGAS option has to be turned on for atleast 10 minutes.

Turn on OPERATE mode. Recommended starting parameters are:

* Energy : 3kV
* Emission : 5 mA
* Focus1 : 1800 V
* Focus2 : 0 V
* Ext : 95%
* PX = PY : 0 mm
* dX = dY : 0 mm

Make sure to optimize these parameters earlier using YAG reference powder, Faraday cup etc.

Fully open DN40CF valve, then slightly open angle valve DN16CF - this valve will be adjusted later to optimize the ion current.

Open the gas supply valve and adjust to reach a pressure of 1E-6 mbar in the chamber.

The ion source is now ready.

#### Switching OFF

Make sure the ion source is not operating. Close the gas supply valve completely. Switch OFF the power supply. After 10 minutes, close the two differential pumping valves (DN40CF and DN16CF).

## X-RAY SOURCE

***ONLY OPERATE AT PRESSURES < 5 E-8 mbar. IF CHAMBER PRESSURE IS HIGHER CONTINUE BAKEOUT OF THE X-RAY AND ION SOURCES ALONG WITH THE CHAMBER. FOLLOW BAKEOUT PROCEDURE MENTIONED IN THE RESPECTIVE MANUALS.***

### Procedure after bakeout / chamber vent

Ensure vacuum is **less than 5E-8 mbar**.

### Switching ON

Turn on the water supply. Flow rate should be greater than 3 l/min.

On the TX400 control unit

1. Before pressing the power button follow steps 2-4.
2. Select Filament 1 (Mg) or Filament 2 (Al).
3. Select Filament control Mode
4. Set Filament Current dial to 0.0.
5. Depress POWER switch to turn the unit ON.
6. Increase filament current **slowly over 5-10 minutes to 2.5 A (for Filament 1 or Mg) or 2.2 A (for filament 2 or Al)** to outgas the filament.
7. Turn the filament current down to zero slowly.

On the Spellman SL600 Supply unit

1. Before switching the power ON set *KILOVOLT* potenmtiometer to zero.
2. Switch POWER on.
3. The interlock closed **INTLK CLSD** display should be illuminated. If not, check the water supply before continuing.
4. Set the *milliamperes* dial to 5.0 (50 %) initially.
5. Turn on the HV by depressing the *HIGH VOLTAGE* (LED illuminates) and slowly increase to **15kV over 10 minutes**. There maybe arcs and pressure bursts initially but the HV should stabilize after 1 or 2 minutes. The *milliamperes* meter should display less than 5 mA, if not the water supply might be contaminated and needs to be cleaned before proceeding.
6. Turn the HV down to the required value (for e.g. 10kV)

On the TX400 control unit

1. Increase the filament current slowly until 3.0 to 5.0 mA emission current is seen (For Mg filament this would be 2.2 to 2.4 A, for Al filament this should be around 2.0 to 2.1 A). **Do not exceed 2.5 A for filament 1 (Mg) or 2.3 A for filament 2 (Al)**.
2. Set the *emission current* dial to 0.5 (5 %) and switch the TX400 unit to *Emission* control.
3. Increase the emission current slowly to 5 mA or 10 mA depending on the requirement. The filaments might outgas during this process, make sure that the pressure in the chamber is **at or below 1E-7 mbar** by regulating the emission current.

> **ATTENTION!!**
>
>**Following filament currents must be seen during normal operation**
>
>* **Filament 1 or Mg : 2.0 - 2.5 A. These are pure tungsten filaments.**
>* **Filament 2 or Al : 2.0 - 2.3 A. These are Yttria coated tungsten filamnets.**

### Switching OFF

On the TX400 control unit

1. Set the emission current to 0. Follow it up by changing the filament current to 0.
2. Switch the TX400 control to *FILAMENT* current control mode.

On the Spellman SL600 unit

1. Set the *KILOVOLT* potentiometer to 0. Follow it up by setting the *milliamperes* potentiometer to 0.
2. Press the *HV OFF* button.
3. Switch off the SL600 unit

Lastly depress the *POWER* switch on the TX400 unit.

After 10 min switch off the cooling water.
